abstract = {In this paper, we propose a single-agent Monte Carlo-based reinforced feature selection method, as well as two efficiency improvement strategies, i.e., early stopping strategy and reward-level interactive strategy. Feature selection is one of the most important technologies in data prepossessing, aiming to find the optimal feature subset for a given downstream machine learning task. Enormous research has been done to improve its effectiveness and efficiency. Recently, the multi-agent reinforced feature selection (MARFS) has achieved great success in improving the performance of feature selection. However, MARFS suffers from the heavy burden of computational cost, which greatly limits its application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient reinforcement feature selection method, which uses one agent to traverse the whole feature set and decides to select or not select each feature one by one. Specifically, we first develop one behavior policy and use it to traverse the feature set and generate training data. And then, we evaluate the target policy based on the training data and improve the target policy by Bellman equation. Besides, we conduct the importance sampling in an incremental way and propose an early stopping strategy to improve the training efficiency by the removal of skew data. In the early stopping strategy, the behavior policy stops traversing with a probability inversely proportional to the importance sampling weight. In addition, we propose a reward-level and training-level interactive strategy to improve the training efficiency via external advice. What’s more, we propose an incremental descriptive statistics method to represent the state with low computational cost. Finally, we design extensive experiments on real-world data to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract = 	 {Physiological signal classification is of great
 significance for health monitoring and medical
 diagnosis. Deep learning-based methods (e.g. RNN and
 CNN) have been used in this domain to obtain
 reliable predictions. However, the performance of
 existing methods is constrained by the long-term
 dependence and irregular vibration of the univariate
 physiological signal sequence. To overcome these
 limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-scale
 Progressive Gated Transformer (MPGT) model to learn
 multi-scale temporal representations for better
 physiological signal classification. The key
 novelties of MPGT are the proposed Multi-scale
 Temporal Feature extraction (MTF) and Progressive
 Gated Transformer (PGT). The former adopts coarse-
 and fine-grained feature extractors to project the
 input signal data into different temporal
 granularity embedding spaces and the latter
 integrates such multi-scale information for data
 representation. Classification task is then
 conducted on the learned
 representations. Experimental results on real-world
 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
 model.}
